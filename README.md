# counter-app

This is a simple counter app

There are a few bugs with it which you are required to fix

Expected outcome:
1. The counter should increase and decrease by 1 each time the button is clicked
2. The value should not give a negative value (eg: -5, -10, -100)
3. The reset button should reset the value to 0
